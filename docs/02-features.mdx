:::caution

Work in progress, so some [features are missing](#not-implemented)

:::


* No reflection or `interface{}`/`any`
  * The json encoding is code-generated, optimized and uses [go-faster/jx](https://github.com/go-faster/jx) for speed and overcoming `encoding/json` limitations
  * Validation is code-generated according to spec
* Code-generated static radix router
* No more boilerplate
  * Structures are generated from OpenAPI v3 specification
  * Arguments, headers, url queries are parsed according to specification into structures
  * String formats like `uuid`, `date`, `date-time`, `uri` are represented by go types directly
* Statically typed client and server
* Convenient support for optional, nullable and optional nullable fields
  * No more pointers
  * Generated `Optional[T]`, `Nullable[T]` or `OptionalNullable[T]` wrappers with helpers
  * Special case for array handling with `nil` semantics relevant to specification
    * When array is optional, `nil` denotes absence of value
    * When nullable, `nil` denotes that value is `nil`
    * When required, `nil` currently the same as `[]`, but is actually invalid
    * If both nullable and required, wrapper will be generated (TODO)
* Generated sum types for oneOf
  * Primitive types (`string`, `number`) are detected by type
  * Discriminator field is used if defined in schema
  * Type is inferred by unique fields if possible
* Extra Go struct field tags in the generated types
* OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics

## Not implemented

* Content-types
  * XML

## Incompatibility

* `duration` is a Go `time.Duration` format, but JSON Schema defines it as [RFC 3339 duration](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#appendix-A).
